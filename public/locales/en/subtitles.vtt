00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.380
Barcelona is a city that often suffers

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.510
from drought situations and our

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.530
water resources are more valuable than ever.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.030
That's why we've found a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.760
solution so everyone can make a

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.250
big difference from their home.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.810
Like many of us, the Costa family wasn't

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.000
aware of how much water they used each day.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.510
Now, with our

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.710
smart MICA sensor, they can track their

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.090
water consumption in real-time.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.460
It's easy: a plumber installs the sensor

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.590
on the home's water meter, which sends accurate data

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.700
to a cloud platform.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.590
From there, our artificial intelligence

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.160
algorithms break down the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.480
water consumption by device, detect

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.780
leaks, and generate personalized advice

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.160
to help you save.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.920
With this data, the family has optimized their water use

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.500
reducing their bills and helping the environment.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.840
With MICA, you not only benefit yourselves, but

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.660
you also contribute to a more sustainable

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.740
Barcelona and help local authorities

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.480
make informed decisions

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.000
about water management.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.200
Empower yourself and join the movement!
