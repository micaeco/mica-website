00:00:01.029 --> 00:00:05.670
Barcelona is a city that often suffers from drought situations and our

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.710
water resources are more valuable than ever.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:08.949
That's why,

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.949
we've found a solution so that everyone can make a big difference from their homes.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.350
Like many of us,

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.270
the Escobar family wasn't aware of how much water they used each day.

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.690
Now,

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:24.069
with our smart sensor Mica,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.889
they can track their water consumption in real-time.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.040
The sensor sends precise data to a cloud platform,

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.479
which, powered by artificial intelligence,

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:35.759
breaks down water usage by device,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.880
detects leaks and provides personalized advice to help them save.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.880
With this data,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.080
the family has optimized their water usage,

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:48.080
reducing their bills and helping the environment.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.680
Using our solution,

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.840
you not only benefit yourselves,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.200
but also contribute to a more sustainable Barcelona and help local authorities make

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.669
informed decisions about water management.

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:03.650
Empower yourself and join the movement.
