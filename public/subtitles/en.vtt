00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.380
Barcelona is a city that often experiences

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.510
drought situations and our

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.530
water resources are more valuable than ever.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.030
That's why we've found a

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.760
solution so everyone can make a

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.250
big difference from their home.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.810
Like many of us, the Costa family wasn't

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.000
aware of how much water they used each day.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.510
Now, with our smart sensor

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.710
MICA, they can track their

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.300
water consumption in real time.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.460
It's easy, first we install the sensor

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.590
on the home's water meter, which sends continuous

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.700
data to a cloud platform.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.590
From here, our artificial

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.160
intelligence algorithms break down the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.180
water consumption by device, detect

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.780
leaks and generate personalized tips

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.160
to help you save.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.920
With this data, the family has optimized their water usage

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.500
reducing their bills and helping the environment.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.840
With MICA you not only benefit yourselves, but

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.660
you also contribute to a more sustainable

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.740
Barcelona and help local authorities

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.480
make informed decisions

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.000
about water management.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.200
Empower yourself and join the movement!
